      <description>People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.
Alan Kay, Creative Think seminar, 1982
 This three-part tutorial provides a quick introduction to FPGA development with SystemVerilog and the Digilent Arty A7 board. No prior experience of FPGA development is required, but basic knowledge of programming concepts is assumed. If you can write a simple program in Arduino, Python, or JavaScript, then you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have any trouble.</description>

      <title>Initialize Memory in Verilog</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s common for a simulation or firmware to need data loading into a memory array, ram, or rom. Fortunately, Verilog provides the $readmemh and $readmemb functions for this very purpose. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of good Verilog documentation online, so using them can be harder than it should be. This article explains the syntax and provides plenty of examples, including how to do this in Xilinx Vivado.
This is part of a new series of handy recipes to solve common FPGA development problems.</description>

      <title>FPGA Tooling on Ubuntu 20.04</title>
      <link>https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-dev-ubuntu-20.04/</link>

      <description>Ubuntu 20.04 (AKA Focal Fossa) includes updated tools and a more responsive desktop (hooray). In this post I test common FPGA tools for compatibility with the Ubuntu 20.04. These tests are in no way exhaustive: I try using the applications as I normally do with an eye to exercising the main functionality.
 Tested: nMigen, Verilator, Vivado In Progress: IceStorm Tools, NextPNR, Quartus, Yosys Planned: RISC-V GCC, SpinalHDL, SymbiYosys  Last updated 2020-04-25: follow WillFlux for future updates.</description>
